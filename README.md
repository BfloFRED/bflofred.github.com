#BfloFRED : Passionate Front-end Web Developers and Advocates

Official Github account for the Buffalo Front&ndash;end Developers meet up group. Meticulously operated and organized in Fred's stead.

Come hang out every month and talk shop, learn cool tricks, engage in thoughtful discussions and debate all centered around Front-end Web Design. This site and files are the product of a community effort where we learn by doing.

##Under the Hood:

- jQuery
- Typekit
- Codekit & Grunt (pick your compiler poison)
- Sass & Compass

##Contributing:
**Branches**

If you're gonna be contributing to the codebase for BfloFRED then you gotta make sure you're doing it from a separate branch and not on FRED's master branch. Also make doubly sure you're naming your branches appropriately. For example&hellip;

    feature/my_new_feature
    hotfix/patch_name

**Pull Requests**

All Pull Requests must contain properly linted, concatenated, compressed and minified code for any and all Javascript and Sass.

##Compiling:
**Codekit**

Whether it is Codekit or Grunt you'll need to compile for produciton. In order to compile for Sass using Codekit we use the ``config.rb file.`` This ruby file controls all our configurations for Compass and Sass compiling magic.

**Grunt**
